## NAGA ANUDEEP YALAMANCHI

My self **Naga Anudeep Yalamanch** from **india, vijayawada** came to united states for my masters. I have completed my undergrad from Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha Engineering college in **Mechanical** stream with a 7.2 cgpa. Now i have changed my major to **ACS** as i thought it was really that easy to complete masters in computer science but now struggling as it was beginning and I don't have any previous knowledge in computer science.The plan of completing masters is good for upgrading my skills.
