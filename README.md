###### My Favorite Sport is Football
My favourite game is **football**. It is a popularly played sport throughout the **world!** The best teams from every country make it to the **world cup**, and people across the globe watch it with interest. I love football because there is a sense of freedom in playing the game. It is physically demanding as we have to run around the field to score a goal and simultaneously defend our side of the goal post. I play football every day in school with my classmates. I also play football with other children in my neighbourhood. It is a great way to make **friends** as you learn to play as a team.
